#+TITLE: Backup Strategies

This records the backup strategies that I will try out, and some
references of tools or methods mentioned that are probably interesting
but I have not seriously consider.

* Consideration of backup
  - the basic idea of backup is to make copy of important data, so
    that it can be restored in case of corruption in the original data
    store
  - for data that is mostly accumulative, i.e. usually more new files
    are added and old files stay unchanged, then one simple idea is to
    keep copying newly added files to the same backup
    - this may work well with media files that we usually keep intact,
      although we may derive new files from old ones, e.g. video or
      image editing
  - for program code or smaller text files (e.g. blog posts, org
    notes), we may use version control such as =git=, which keeps all
    the committed history
  - but we may be lazy and do not want to worry about using which
    strategy for which type of data, so we can still make backup,
    e.g. of the home directory
  - however, we may be dissatified with always overwriting the same
    backup copy, because we may want to get back the copy of some
    files at an earlier date, e.g.
    - day one you make a backup
    - day two, you make a change to some file (assuming not using
      version control), and also backup, overwriting day one's backup
    - day three, you make large changes to that file, and also backup,
      overwriting day two's backup
    - day four, you regret day three's changes, and want day two's
      version of the file, but you will not have it anymore
  - then a simple idea is to make a new copy each time we 

* Some common terminologies
  - full backup
  - incremental backup
  - differential backup
  - 3-2-1 backup strategy
* Strategies to try
I will probably adopt all these strategies, but some may take more
time to setup, so may be delayed.
