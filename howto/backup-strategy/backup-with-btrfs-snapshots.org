#+TITLE: Backup with Btrfs Snapshots

* Create directory for checkpoints (once)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # can put at a convenient place
  # since I mainly snapshot the home, so put it under root
  sudo mkdir -p /.snapshots
#+END_SRC

* Create checkpoint
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # can give a convenient name for the checkpoint, here use ${device}-{directory}-{date}
  sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /home /.snapshots/laptop-e495-home-2025-03-02
#+END_SRC

* Send checkpoint to backup device
- *NOTE*
  - seems it is better to have a partition (or sub-volume) specifically to store the snapshots
  - not sure if this can have better sharing for regular snapshots
- command
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo btrfs send /.snapshots/laptop-e495-home-2025-03-02 | sudo btrfs receive /media/peter/lenovo-backup/
#+END_SRC
